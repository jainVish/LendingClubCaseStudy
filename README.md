# Welcom to Lending Club Case Study:
> LendingClub has become one of the more reputable destinations for providing the online loans. It helped to originate peer-to-peer marketplace lending, which matches borrowers with investors who are willing to fund the loans.LendingClub is best suited to serve borrowers with responsible payment records and established financial histories.

## General Info
*  Lending Club Case Study: We have lending loan data of consumer finance company which are providing various type of loan to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
	* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
	* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. client is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
* The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Technologies Used
* We are using EDA to do the analysis here using python with pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, plotly, plotly.graph_objs, math.

## Conclusions
* Defaulter rate is higher when employee length are 1 year, 7 years, and >=10 years.
* Minimum defaulter rate exist for 9 years employee length.
* Maximum defaulter rate for emp length >=10 years.
* Grade is propotonal to Loan Defaulter Probability.
* We can see that , most of the loan default probablity is seen for small_business,so bank should be extra careful while approving the loan for such businesses
* Minimum defaulter rate showing for Major Purchase purpose.
* We can see, as annual income is @[proportional to] probability of being defaulter.It is reaching up to 19%
* We can see that as interest rate is increasing chance of being defaulter is also increased. when the interest rate touches more than 15% , risk of default rate is increasing.
* We can see that default rate is increasing , when the loan amount/funded amount is increasing at the alarming rate
